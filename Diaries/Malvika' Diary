Time spent: 2 hr- 2.5 hr
  -The iniitial idea was to create an animal image generator
  -My mind diverted into making a bot that answers questions your questions.
  -I worked on it and its working! Not included here since it is not a part of the assignment. 
  -I created the animal bot. But, the images are just stored as links which I don't like. 
  -I'd like them to be uploaded as images. 
  -Might work on it in the morning, I am too tired, haven't slept in 2 days!

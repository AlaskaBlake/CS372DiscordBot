# CS372DiscordBot

This is repository that can be used for people to create their own discord bot. This code was made for a discord bot token to be put 
in the location listed in the main.py file. Once the token is put in and main.py is compiled with the other files in the "cog" folder, 
you will have a fully functional discord bot with the capabilities listed below. For how to make a discord bot, inviting it to your
server, and getting its token see below as well.
